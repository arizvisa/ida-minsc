"""
Tagfix module

This module is provided to a user to allow one to rebuild the
cache that is built when a database is finished processing. If
the cache is corrupted through some means, this module can be
used to rebuild the tag-cache by manually scanning the currently
defined tags and resetting its references in order to allow one
to query again.

To manually rebuild the cache for the database, use the following::

    > tools.tagfix.everything()

Likewise to rebuild the cache for just the globals or the contents::

    > tools.tagfix.globals()
    > tools.tagfix.contents()
