      IDA-minsc is a plugin for IDA Pro that assists a user with scripting the
      IDAPython plugin that is bundled with the disassembler. This plugin groups the
      different aspects of the IDAPython API into a simpler format which allows a
      reverse engineer to script different aspects of their work with very little
      investment.

A number of concepts are introduced such as a tagging system, support for
multicased functions, and filtering with the intention that most search
and annotation issues can be performed with just a few lines of code. This
should enable a user to write quick, hacky, temporary code that can be used
to augment their reversing endeavors without distraction.

This plugin is dependent upon IDAPython, and supports all of the different
platforms that IDA supports which includes Windows, Linux, and MacOS. If
your instance of IDA was not installed with Python, or you wish to switch
betwen Python 2.x or the Python 3.x series, then please refer to the
instructions at section :ref:`1.4<install-downgrade>` for how to change
the Python runtime that IDAPython uses in your installation. At the present
time, only IDA version 6.8 up to IDA 7.6.210319 are currently supported.
