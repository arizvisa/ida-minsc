<p>This project provides an interesting interface based on some research
[<a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-references"><span class="std std-ref">1</span></a>] that was done by one of the authors at the
Ekoparty conference in 2011. The author is grateful to TippingPoint/3com/HP
for providing him the resources and time in which to do this research.</p>
<p>Typically when recalling addresses in an IDA database, users will use one of the
already existing facilities for navigation. This includes things such as names or
marks. At this point, the user will utilize names or comments in order to recall
what present work was being done at a particular location. One of the unfortunate
attributes of this is that it is of variable difficulty to share this knowledge
with other users. This can be any number of reasons related to inconsistency, but
it’s suggested that this is because each reverser has a different personality as
well as different intentions for each reversing project.</p>
<p>In order to improve this methodology that users of IDA Pro tend to gravitate
towards, a system based on the concept of treating IDA as a key-value store
was introduced. This system abuses IDA’s comments in order to allow a user
to programatically categorize information that a user might have inferred
during their reversing endeavor in the hopes to improve the way that a user
navigates the database and shares information with other users.</p>
<p>This system allows for a user to store a primitive python object within a comment,
which can then be decoded back into its original type, thus allowing a user to
store and retrieve a python object associated with an address. This is described
in detail later at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-encoding"><span class="std std-ref">Tag encoding/decoding</span></a>. These values can then later be queried
in order to reference the addresses of the types that the user has marked. This
is also described in detail at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-querying"><span class="std std-ref">Querying tags</span></a>.</p>
<p>Using such a mechanism, facilitates a user to be able to quickly tag
a number of related functions or addresses, and perform some sort of
processing against them. The work required to perform tasks such as
tagging all the handlers related to some CGI binary, tagging various
instructions according to some attribute in order to later color them,
tagging an instruction address with a breakpoint command to later feed
to a debugger, or even simply tagging the results of a hit-tracer for later
review is greatly simplified.</p>

<span id="tagging-build"></span><h2>2.2.1. Building the tag-cache<a class="headerlink" href="#building-the-tag-cache" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When creating an IDA database, this plugin will hook IDA in order to determine
when the auto-analysis queue is empty. When this happens, this plugin will
proceed to build the tag cache. When building the tag cache, the plugin will
output the number of functions completed relative to the total number of
defined functions. This will be in the form of a progress bar that looks like
the following.</p>
<img alt="image of progress bar" class="align-center" src="_images/tagging-progress.png" />
<p>Once producing the tag cache, the database is ready to be queried. If the
user wants to rebuild the tag cache, or to build a cache for a database that
has previously been built. Please see <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-modules-tagfix"><span class="std std-ref">Tag modules – tagfix</span></a> for
more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tag-types">
<span id="tagging-types"></span><h2>2.2.2. Tag types<a class="headerlink" href="#tag-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Comments are hence split up into two parts that compose a dictionary, these are
the “key” and the “value”. Each location or object that can be tagged, will
include a specially formatted comment that isolates these components so that
they can later be queried. These tags are then cached in a netnode so that they
be easily queried (see <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-querying"><span class="std std-ref">Querying tags</span></a>) to then later revisit or extract
information to process.</p>
<p>In essence, these tags are grouped into two different types. One of which
is the “global” tag. A “global” tag is used to store attributes about a
particular global such as a function, or an address outside of a function.
These tags can then be used to search the database for something of reference
which is a significant improvement to the way that marks work, and works around
the limitation that a database has on its limited number of marks.</p>
<p>The other type of tag is known as a “contents” tag. A “contents” tag is used to
store attributes about an address that is inside a function and is commonly
associated with the instructions that belong to a function. This allows one to
store attributes describing the semantics of what is being reversed at a given
address within a function.</p>
<p>When querying a tag, it is important to distinguish between which tag the user
wishes to search through. This is described in detail at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-querying"><span class="std std-ref">Querying tags</span></a>.
Some examples of querying are described at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples-querying"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Querying</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tag-formats">
<span id="tagging-format"></span><h2>2.2.3. Tag formats<a class="headerlink" href="#tag-formats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to facilitate support tags and still allow for a user to quickly
comprehend the intention of a tag. Tags are actually encoded within comments
at the address that is “tagged”. This is done by encoding the tag using a
specific newline-delimited format.</p>
<p>This format represents the attributes commonly associated with a dictionary. If
a user chooses to not use this special format, then when utilizing the tag api
the entire comment is treated as an “empty” tag using an empty string as its key.
Please see <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Application or Retrieval</span></a> for an example of this.</p>
<p>Due to a limitation of IDA with regards to the size of comments and this abuse
of using comments to store tag values, tags have a limited size. If the user
wishes to store a long tag at an address it is necessary for them to break it
down into smaller components that do not exceed the maximum number of characters
that IDA allots for each comment or to use another storage mechanism entirely.
It is recommended by the author to only store light information and if a large
value needs to be stored, that a user should really just use another storage
mechanism. Long (and hidden) tags may be supported in the future, however.</p>
<p>The format for a tag to an address within the database can look like the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight-tasm notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">call</span>    <span class="nv">sub_58B674</span>      <span class="c1">; [note] this calls some parser of some kind</span>
                        <span class="c1">; [mark] (0x4, &#39;this is the 4th mark&#39;)</span>
                        <span class="c1">; [break] .printf &quot;calling sub_58b674!\\n&quot;; dc @esp L4; p &quot;r @eax&quot;</span>
                        <span class="c1">; [references] set([0x58b012, 0x581061, 0x501212])</span>
                        <span class="c1">; [floating-value] float(0.500000)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When applying a tag to a function, this can look like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-tasm notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">; [node-type] leaf</span>
<span class="c1">; [note] this seems to do something different based on the file type?</span>
<span class="c1">; [synopsis] returns an unmodified @eax if by(ap_0-9) is zero, otherwise it returns @edx</span>
<span class="c1">; [input] {&#39;%eax&#39; : &#39;p_bufferObject?&#39;, &#39;%edx&#39; : &#39;v_offset&#39;}</span>
<span class="c1">; Attributes: bp-based frame</span>

<span class="nf">sub_5801F4</span>      <span class="nv">proc</span> <span class="nv">near</span>
<span class="nf">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a user chooses to not explicitly use the tagging API and wishes to use IDA’s
regular commenting interface instead, they will simply need to specify the key
name with brackets (“[” and “]”) with the value for the key immediately following.
This should look similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[synopsis] this is what i suspect this function is doing
[note] this is some note or whatever
[numbers] set([0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5])
[dict] {&#39;key1&#39; : &#39;value1&#39;, &#39;key2&#39; : 0x2a}
[float] float(2.71828182846)
[linked] 0x51b2080
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>IDA supports two different types of comments within the database. A comment can
be either a “repeatable” comment, or a “non-repeatable” comment. By default when
tagging, this type of comment is automatically chosen based on whether the address
belongs to a function, or a global. When fetching a tag, however, both types
of comments are combined whilst giving priority to the automatically chosen
comment type.</p>
<p>When tagging an address belonging to a function’s contents, the default comment
type of “non-repeatable” will be chosen. When tagging to a global, or an actual
function, the comment type that will be chosen will be “repeatable.” This choice
is hidden behind the tagging API.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tag-encoding-decoding">
<span id="tagging-encoding"></span><h2>2.2.4. Tag encoding/decoding<a class="headerlink" href="#tag-encoding-decoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to allow a user to store and retrieve a primitive python types
whilst still allowing for them to visually read the contents of the type,
different python types are encoded in particular ways.</p>
<p>Integral types, and strings are specially encoded. Integers are always stored
as hexadecimal numbers in order to facilitate a user double-clicking on it to
have IDA navigate to this address. (This assumes that the user is capable of
reading hexadecimal. This is an integral part of reversing and it is highly
recommended that the user familiarizes his or herself with this numerical
format).</p>
<p>Strings are escaped in a few ways, replacing characters that might
interfere with the <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-format"><span class="std std-ref">Tag formats</span></a> with their backslash-prefixed
equivalents. When retrieving a string encoded within a tag, these
characters will then be decoded into their original forms.</p>
<p>Types such as the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>, <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>, or <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>,
are typically encoded as the <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">repr()</span></code> of their instance. This allows
the usage of <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval()</span></code> to decode it back into a type. The iterable
types such as <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>, however, are iterated
through in order to convert integers into their hexadecimal equivalents
similar to the way integers are encoded.</p>
<p>Custom python objects, iterators, or callables are unfortunately not supported
as tags. If the user really wishes to store these types, however, it is possible
for one to serialize a type, and then store it as a string inside a tag. As
previousy mentioned, however, this is not recommended and it is suggested by
the author that a user uses an alternative storage mechanism.</p>
<p>If a user wishes to go against these recommendations, however, once can
store an arbitrary type by using either <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pickle()</span></code> or <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marshal()</span></code>
to serialize their object, applying some compression to the resulting data,
followed by encoding into a character set using “base64”, encoding to hex,
or some similar mechanism.</p>

<div class="section" id="querying-tags">
<span id="tagging-querying"></span><h2>2.2.5. Querying tags<a class="headerlink" href="#querying-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When initially creating a database, this project will hook IDA in order to
identify a good time to pre-build the tag cache. Once IDA has finished its
analysis, the tag cache will begin to be built. This consists of iterating
through the different places that can be tagged and reference counting whats
available. By default all comments that do not fit the correct format
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-format"><span class="std std-ref">Tag formats</span></a>) will be internally treated as the “empty” tag.</p>
<p>Once the creation of this cache has been completed, this project will keep
track of any comments and tags that are created by the user and automatically
update the cache. This will then allow a user to quickly query the tags that
they have marked up in a database. If this cache gets corrupted in some way,
one can repair the cache by using the module <a class="reference internal" href="modules/custom-tagfix.html#module-tagfix" title="tagfix"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tagfix</span></code></a>. Please see
<a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-modules-tagfix"><span class="std std-ref">Tag modules – tagfix</span></a> for more information.</p>
<p>When querying a tag, as mentioned before, the tag’s type is of significant
importance. This is due to there being two different ways of querying them
based on the type.</p>
<p>Within the <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#module-database" title="database"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database</span></code></a> namespace are the functions <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.select" title="database.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.select()</span></code></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.selectcontents" title="database.selectcontents"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.selectcontents()</span></code></a>. The <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.select" title="database.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.select()</span></code></a> function is
used for querying all of the global tags as well as any tags made explicitly to a
function.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.selectcontents" title="database.selectcontents"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.selectcontents()</span></code></a> function, however, is used to return the
functions that contain the desired tags within the function’s contents. Once the
functions in the database have been identified, the user can then use
<a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.select" title="function.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.select()</span></code></a> function to query the contents of a function for
specific tags.</p>
<p>When calling either <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.select" title="database.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.select()</span></code></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.select" title="function.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.select()</span></code></a>,
an iterator is returned. This iterator yields a tuple containing the address the
tag was found at, as well as a dictionary containing the values of the tags that
were queried. This then allows a user to act on the tags such as emitting them
to the console, or storing them in another data structure. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples-querying-globals"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Querying “Global” tags</span></a>
for such an example.</p>
<p>When calling <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.selectcontents" title="database.selectcontents"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.selectcontents()</span></code></a>, however, an iterator that returns
the function and the tag membership is returned. Each iteration of this iterator
will yield the address of the function, followed by a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span></code> of the
contents tags that were found in the function. This tuple can then be immediately
passed to <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.select" title="function.select"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.select()</span></code></a> in order to iterate through all the contents
tags matched within the database. See <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples-querying-content"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Querying “Contents” tags</span></a>
for how a user can use this.</p>
<p>Each of these functions takes a variable number of parameters as well as boolean
types that specify whether to require specific tags in order to return a result,
or optionally include tags if they’re defined for an address. If the keyword
<code class="xref py py-data docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">And</span></code> is specified as an argument, then any of the tags specified are
required in order to yield an address. If the keyword <code class="xref py py-data docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Or</span></code> is specified
then this informs the function to optionally include any tags that were requested
if they are defined for the address that is returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-retrieval-of-tags">
<span id="tagging-usage"></span><h2>2.2.6. Storage/Retrieval of tags<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-retrieval-of-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The other aspect of the tagging api is the programmatic storage and retrieval
of tags defined at a particular address. This functionality is performed
by either the <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.tag" title="database.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.tag()</span></code></a> or the <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.tag" title="function.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.tag()</span></code></a>
functions. It’s important to distinguish that the namespace these functions
are contained in, do not distinguish whether a tag is a “global” or a
“contents” tag.</p>
<p>As specified in <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#module-database" title="database"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database</span></code></a>, the primary type that is typically passed
to its functions is an address. This implies that <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.tag" title="database.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.tag()</span></code></a> can
be used to tag an address. This address may belong to a function’s contents
or a global address. <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.tag" title="function.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.tag()</span></code></a>, however, is used to tag the
function itself. This is demonstrated at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Application or Retrieval</span></a>.</p>
<p>This implies that <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.tag" title="database.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.tag()</span></code></a> is used to tag a specific address
belonging to a function’s contents or a global, whereas <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.tag" title="function.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.tag()</span></code></a>
is used to tag the function itself. This is demonstrated at <a class="reference internal" href="#tagging-examples"><span class="std std-ref">Examples – Application or Retrieval</span></a>.</p>
<p>When executing either of these tag functions, there are 4 variations of each
of them. The first variations is when only a tag name is provided. This
variation will return the value of the tag at a given address and is thus used
for reading a particular tag from an address. This looks like the following
for <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.tag" title="database.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.tag()</span></code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;mytagname&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The next variation takes a tag name and its value and is thus used to write
a value with the specified tag name at an address within the database. If a
tag is being overwritten, this variation will return the original value
of the tag that was overwritten. Some examples of how this can look like for
for the <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.tag" title="function.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.tag()</span></code></a> function:</p>

<p>The third variation is responsible for removing a tag at a given address.
This is done by providing a tag name along with the python type <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.
When removing a tag name, the value of the tag name is always returned. This
allows a user to save the tag name in case they wish to re-apply it elsewhere.

<p>There are a few modules that are provided within this project that allows one
to interact with all of the tags defined in a database. This can be used to
perform various tasks such as exporting all the tags within a database to
serialize for later importing, translating tags within the database in order
to match up to another database, etc. These modules are available via the
<code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">custom</span></code> namespace.</p>

functionality is performed by either <a class="reference internal" href="modules/database.html#database.tag" title="database.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">database.tag()</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="modules/function.html#function.tag" title="function.tag"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function.tag()</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>To tag all of the marks inside the database:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">descr</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">marks</span><span class="p">():</span>
      <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;mark&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">descr</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To fetch the empty tag at the current address and then print it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="nb">repr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">res</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To export all of the tags for anything tagged “synopsis” in the database:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tags</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;synopsis&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
      <span class="n">res</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To rename all of the “empty” tags in a function to “comment”:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">ea</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">func</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">iterate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">):</span>
          <span class="n">old</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
          <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;comment&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">old</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="k">continue</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To obnoxiously tag every function with an index:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ea</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">functions</span><span class="p">()):</span>
      <span class="n">func</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ea</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;index&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To prefix all tags with the current username using the cache:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">getpass</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getpass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getuser</span><span class="p">()</span>

<h2>2.2.10. Suggested tag names<a class="headerlink" href="#suggested-tag-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When using tag names within a database, any tag name can be used. Tags that
are wrapped with double-underscores (“__”) may also have additional useful
side effects. Although any tag names can be used, it’s recommended by the
author to choose consistent names to simplify exchanging knowledge with
other users. Some recommended names are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="21%" />
<col width="79%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">synopsis</span></code></td>
<td>The potential semantics of a reversed function</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__color__</span></code></td>
<td>The RGB color of an item at a particular address</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code></td>
<td>The name associated with an address</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">note</span></code></td>
<td>Any general notes about an address determined by the
user</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marks</span></code></td>
<td>A set containing any marks contained within a function</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mark</span></code></td>
<td>A string containing the description for a mark at an
address</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object</span></code></td>
<td>The name or address(es) of a related vtable applied to
a function that is used to call a method.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code></td>
<td>A dictionary mapping register arguments to a function</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code></td>
<td>A list containing the registers that a result is
composed of</td>
