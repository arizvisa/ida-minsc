tags -- Tags module
===================

This module exposes tools for exporting the currently defined tags
within the database. Once exported, these tags can then be pickled
or then re-applied to the same or another database. Some options
are allowed which will let a user apply translations to the tags
before applying them to a target database.

To fetch all of the tags from the database::

    > res = tools.tags.read()

To export only specific tags from the database::

    > res = tools.tags.export('tag1', 'tag2', ...)

To apply previously read tags to the database::

    > tools.tags.apply(res)

To apply previously read tags with different names to the database::

    > tools.tags.apply(res, tag1='my_tag1', tag2='my_tag2', ...)

Function list
-------------

The functions that are available in this module use multicased
functions and aliases. For more information on this, please see
:ref:`multicase-aliases` and :ref:`multicase-functions`.

.. py:function:: addressToLocation(ea, chunks=None)
   
   Convert the address ``ea`` to a ``(function, id, offset)``.
   
   The fields ``id`` and ``offset`` represent the chunk index and the
   offset into the chunk for the function at ``ea``. If the list
   ``chunks`` is specified as a parameter, then use it as a tuple
   of ranges in order to calculate the correct address.
   
   :param ea: an address to possibly convert to a location
   :param chunks: the list of chunks to convert the address with
   
.. py:function:: list()
   
   Return the tags for the all of the function contents within the database as a set.
   
.. py:function:: locationToAddress(loc)
   
   Convert the function location ``loc`` back into an address.
   
   :param loc: an address or a location tuple to convert to an address
   
.. py:function:: lvarNameQ(name)
   
   Determine whether a ``name`` is something that IDA named automatically.
   
   :param name: the string to check for an IDA naming scheme

These are the namespaces available within this module. Namespaces
group similar functions that can be used typically for the same
concept. Please see :ref:`multicase-namespaces` for more
information on namespaces. For more information on multicase
functions or aliases, please see :ref:`multicase-functions` or
:ref:`multicase-aliases`.

.. _ns-tags-apply:

**********
tags.apply
**********

This namespace contains tools that can be used to apply tags that
have been previously read back into the database.

Various functions defined within this namespace take a variable number of
keyword arguments which represent a mapping for the tag names. When a
tag name was specified, this mapping will be used to rename the tags
before actually writing them back into the database.

.. py:function:: apply(Globals_Contents_Frames, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the tags in the argument ``(Globals, Contents, Frames)`` from the ``Globals_Contents_Frames`` tuple back into the database.
   
   :param Globals_Contents_Frames: a tuple composed of the global tags, contents tags, and frame members that were read
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to translate the original tag names with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.content(Contents, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply ``Contents`` back into a function's contents within the database.
   
   :param Contents: the contents tags to apply
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to map the original tags with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.contents(Contents, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the tags in ``Contents`` back into each function within the database.
   
   :param Contents: the contents tags to apply
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to map the original tags with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.everything(Globals_Contents_Frames, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the tags in the argument ``(Globals, Contents, Frames)`` from the ``Globals_Contents_Frames`` tuple back into the database.
   
   :param Globals_Contents_Frames: a tuple composed of the global tags, contents tags, and frame members that are to be applied
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to translate the original tag names with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.frame(ea, frame, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the fields from ``frame`` back into the function at ``ea``.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function to apply the frame to
   :param frame: the frame members to apply
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to map the original tags with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.frames(Frames, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the fields from ``Frames`` back into each function's frame.
   
   :param Frames: the frame members to apply
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to map the original tags with before applying them to the database
   
.. py:function:: apply\.globals(Globals, \*\*tagmap)
   
   Apply the tags in ``Globals`` back into the database.
   
   :param Globals: the globals tags to apply
   :param \*\*tagmap: a dictionary used to map the original tags with before applying them to the database
   
.. _ns-tags-export:

***********
tags.export
***********

This namespace contains tools that can be used to quickly
export specific tags out of the database using the cache.

If ``location`` is specified as true, then read each contents tag
according to its location rather than an address. This allows one
to perform a translation of the tags in case the function chunks
are at different addresses than when the tags were read.

.. py:function:: export(\*tags, \*\*location)
   
   Read the specified tags within the database using the cache.
   
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the tags to export
   :param \*\*location: if ``location`` is true, then export the contents tags as a location instead of an address
   
.. py:function:: export\.content(F, \*tags, \*\*location)
   
   Iterate through the specified ``tags`` belonging to the contents of the function at ``ea`` using the cache.
   
   :param F: the function to export the content from
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the contents tags to export
   :param \*\*location: if ``location`` is true, then export the contents tags as a location instead of an address
   
.. py:function:: export\.contents(\*tags, \*\*location)
   
   Iterate through the specified contents ``tags`` within the database using the cache.
   
   Each iteration yields a tuple of the format ``(location, tags)`` where
   ``location`` can be either an address or a chunk identifier and offset
   depending on whether ``location`` was specified as true or not.
   
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the contents tags to export
   :param \*\*location: if ``location`` is true, then export the contents tags as a location instead of an address
   
.. py:function:: export\.everything(\*tags, \*\*location)
   
   Read all of the specified ``tags`` within the database using the cache.
   
   Returns a tuple of the format ``(Globals, Contents, Frames)``. Each field
   is a dictionary keyed by location or offset that retains the tags that
   were read. If the boolean ``location`` was specified then key each
   contents tag by location instead of address.
   
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the tags to export
   :param \*\*location: if ``location`` is true, then export the contents tags as a location instead of an address
   
.. py:function:: export\.frame(F, \*tags)
   
   Iterate through each field containing the specified ``tags`` within the frame belonging to the function ``ea``.
   
   :param F: the function to export the frame members from
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the tags used to select the frame members to export
   
.. py:function:: export\.frames(\*tags)
   
   Iterate through the fields in each function's frame containing the specified ``tags``.
   
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the tags used to select the frame members to export
   
.. py:function:: export\.globals(\*tags)
   
   Iterate through all of the specified global ``tags`` within the database using the cache.
   
   :param \*tags: an iterable of the global tags to export
   
.. _ns-tags-read:

*********
tags.read
*********

This namespace contains tools that can be used to manually read
tags out of the database without using the cache.

If ``location`` is specified as true, then read each contents tag
according to its location rather than an address. This allows one
to perform a translation of the tags in case the function chunks
are at different addresses than when the tags were read.

.. py:function:: read(location=False)
   
   Read all of the tags defined within the database.
   
   :param location: whether to read the contents tags as an address or a location
   
.. py:function:: read\.content(ea)
   
   Iterate through every tag belonging to the contents of the function at ``ea``.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function to yield the content for
   
.. py:function:: read\.contents(location=False)
   
   Iterate through the contents tags for all the functions within the database.
   
   Each iteration yields a tuple of the format ``(location, tags)`` where
   ``location`` can be either an address or a chunk identifier and offset
   depending on whether ``location`` was specified as true or not.
   
   :param location: whether to read the contents tags as an address or a location
   
.. py:function:: read\.everything(location=False)
   
   Read all of the tags defined within the database.
   
   Returns a tuple of the format ``(Globals, Contents, Frames)``. Each field
   is a dictionary keyed by location or offset that retains the tags that
   were read. If the boolean ``location`` was specified then key each
   contents tag by location instead of address.
   
   :param location: whether to read the contents tags as an address or a location
   
.. py:function:: read\.frame(ea)
   
   Iterate through each field within the frame belonging to the function ``ea``.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function containing the frame members to yield
   
.. py:function:: read\.frames()
   
   Iterate through the fields of each frame for all the functions defined within the database.
   
.. py:function:: read\.globals()
   
   Iterate through all of the tags defined globally witin the database.
