.. py:module:: tools

tools -- Tools module
=====================

This module provides miscellaneous tools that a user may find
useful in their reversing adventures. This includes classes
for performing address translations, coloring marks or tags,
recursively walking through basic blocks until a sentinel
block has been reached, or even recursivelly walking a
function's childrens until a particular sentinel function
is encountered.

The tools defined within here are unorganized and thus may
shift around during development as they find their place.

-------------
Function list
-------------

The functions that are available in this module use multicased
functions and aliases. For more information on this, please see
:ref:`multicase-aliases` and :ref:`multicase-functions`.

.. py:function:: above(ea, includeSegment=False)
   
   Return all of the function names and their offset that calls the function at ``ea``.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function to output calls to
   :param includeSegment: whether to include the segment name in the output
   
.. py:function:: below(ea, includeSegment=False)
   
   Return all of the function names and their offset that are called by the function at ``ea``.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function to output calls from
   :param includeSegment: whether to include the segment name in the output
   
.. py:function:: checkmarks()
   
   Emit all functions that contain more than 1 mark within them.
   
   As an example, if marks are used to keep track of backtraces then
   this tool will emit where those backtraces intersect.
   
.. py:function:: collect(ea, sentinel)
   
   Collect all the basic blocks starting at address ``ea`` and recurse until a terminating block is encountered.
   
   If the set ``sentinel`` is specified, then its addresses are used as
   sentinel blocks and collection will terminate when those blocks are
   reached.
   
   :param ea: the address of the basic block to start at
   :param sentinel: an iterable containing the addresses of any basic blocks to terminate at
   
.. py:function:: collectcall(ea, sentinel=set)
   
   Collect all of the function calls starting at function ``ea`` and recurse until a terminating function is encountered.
   
   If the set ``sentinel`` is specified, then its addresses are used as
   sentinel functions and collection will terminate when one of those
   functions are reached.
   
   :param ea: the address of the function to start at
   :param sentinel: an iterable containing the addresses of any functions to terminate at
   
.. py:function:: colormarks(color=0x7f007f)
   
   Walk through the current list of marks whilst coloring them with the specified ``color``.
   
   Each mark's address is tagged with its description, and if the
   address belongs to a function, the function is also tagged with the
   address of the marks that it contains.
   
   :param color: the rgb color value to color each mark address with
   
.. py:function:: makecall(ea=None, target=None)
   
   Output the function call at ``ea`` and its arguments with the address they originated from.
   
   If ``target`` is specified, then assume that the instruction is
   calling ``target`` instead of the target address that the call
   is referencing.
   
   :param ea: the address of a call instruction
   :param target: the address that the call instruction branches to
   
.. py:function:: map(F, \*\*kwargs)
   
   Execute the callback ``F`` on all functions in the database. Synonymous to ``map(F, database.functions())`` but with some extra logging to display the current progress.
   
   The ``F`` parameter is defined as a function taking either an
   :py:obj:`(address, \*\*kwargs)<>` or a :py:obj:`(index, address, \*\*kwargs)<>`. Any
   keyword arguments are passed to ``F`` unmodified.
   
   :param F: the callback to execute on each function
   :param \*\*kwargs: any extra arguments to pass to the callback
   
.. py:function:: recovermarks()
   
   Walk through the tags made by :py:obj:`colormarks` and re-create the marks that were found.
   
   This is useful if any marks were accidentally deleted and can be used for
   recovering them as long as they were initally tagged properly.

Class list
----------

Classes provide the definition necessary to instantiate an object.
In most cases, a class is returned when calling one of the prior
listed functions and thus have no need to be manually instantiated.
Classes may also have aliases defined for them. Please refer to the
documentation for the class to see what is available. For more
information on aliases, please see :ref:`multicase-aliases`.

******
remote
******

.. py:class:: remote
   
   An object that can be used to translate addresses to and from
   a debugging target so that one does not need to rebase their
   entire database, or come up with some other tricks to translate
   a binary address to its runtime address.
   
   .. py:method:: get(self, ea)
      
      Translate a remote address to the local database address.
      
      :param ea: a remote address to convert to the database address
      
   .. py:method:: go(self, ea)
      
      Seek the database to the specified remote address.
      
      :param ea: the remote address to seek to in the database
      
   .. py:method:: put(self, ea)
      
      Translate a local database address to the remote address.
      
      :param ea: the local address in the database to convert to a remote one
