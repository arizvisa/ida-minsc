.. py:module:: structure

structure -- Structure module
=============================

This module exposes a number of tools and defines some classes that
can be used to interacting with the structures defined in the database.
The classes defined by this module wrap IDA's structure API and expose
a simpler interface that can be used to perform various operations
against a structure such as renaming or enumerating the structure's
members.

The base argument type for getting a :py:obj:`structure_t` can be either a name,
an identifier, or an index. Typically one will call :py:obj:`structure.by`
with either identifier type which will then return an instance of their
:py:obj:`structure_t`.

To list the different structures available in the database, one can use
:py:obj:`structure.list` with their chosen method of filtering. This will
list all of the available structures at which point the user can then
request it by passing an identifer to :py:obj:`structure.by`. The chosen
methods of filtering are:

- ``name`` - Match the structures to a structure name
- ``like`` - Filter the structure names according to a glob
- ``regex`` - Filter the structure names according to a regular-expression
- ``index`` - Match the structures by its index
- ``identifier`` or ``id`` - Match the structure by its id which is a :py:obj:`idaapi.uval_t`
- ``size`` - Filter the structures for any matching the specified size
- ``greater`` or ``ge`` - Match structures that are larger (inclusive) than the specified size
- ``gt`` - Match structures that are larger (exclusive) than the specified size
- ``less`` or ``le`` - Match structures that are smaller (inclusive) than the specified size
- ``lt`` - Match structures that are smaller (exclusive) than the specified size
- ``predicate`` - Filter the structures by passing the id (:py:obj:`idaapi.uval_t`) to a callable

Some examples of using these keywords are as follows::

    > structure.list('my*')
    > iterable = structure.iterate(regex='__.*')
    > result = structure.search(index=42)

Class list
----------

Classes provide the definition necessary to instantiate an object.
In most cases, a class is returned when calling one of the prior
listed functions and thus have no need to be manually instantiated.
Classes may also have aliases defined for them. Please refer to the
documentation for the class to see what is available. For more
information on aliases, please see :ref:`multicase-aliases`.

********

********

.. py:class:: member_t
   
   This object is an abstraction around a single member belonging to
   a structure. A member within a structue contains a number of
   properties which this object will expose. Some of these properties
   allow for a user to modify the member's :py:obj:`type` or :py:obj:`name`. The
   :py:obj:`tag` method is also provided to allow for a user to annotate the
   member similar to the database or a function's contents. Another
   method, :py:obj:`refs` will allow one to enumerate everything in the
   database that references said member.
   
   .. py:attribute:: comment

members_t
*********

.. py:class:: members_t
   
   This object is an abstraction around all the members belonging to
   a specific IDA structure. This object is implicitly part of a
   :py:obj:`structure_t` and allows one to access each member of the structure
   by its index as well as create new members and remove existing ones
   from the structure.
   
   To list the different members available in the structure, one can
   use :py:obj:`structure.list` with a chosen method of filtering. This will
   list all of the available members that match the keyword that they
   specified. The keywords that are available to filter members are:
   
   - ``name`` - Match the structure member by a name
   - ``offset`` - Match the structure member by its offset
   - ``like`` - Filter the structure members according to a glob
   - ``regex`` - Filter the structure members according to a regular-expression
   - ``index`` - Match the structure member by its index
   - ``fullname`` - Filter the structure members by matching its full name according to a glob
   - ``comment`` or ``comments`` - Filter the structure members by applying a glob to its comment
   - ``identifier`` or ``id`` - Match the structure member by its identifier
   - ``greater`` or ``ge`` - Filter the structure members for any after the specified offset (inclusive)
   - ``gt`` - Filter the structure members for any after the specified offset (exclusive)
   - ``less`` or ``le`` - Filter the structure members for any before the specified offset (inclusive)
   - ``lt`` - Filter the structure members for any before the specified offset (exclusive)
   - ``predicate`` - Filter the structure members by passing the :py:obj:`member_t` to a callable
   
   Some examples of using these keywords are as follows::
   
       > st.members.list('field_4*')
       > iterable = st.members.iterate(like='p_*')
       > result = st.members.by(offset=0x2a)

.. py:class:: structure_t
   
   This object is an abstraction around an IDA structure type. This
   allows for one to treat an IDA structure as a regular python object.
   A number of methods and properties are provided in order to access
   certain attributes of the structure.
   
   To access the members belonging to the structure, one can use the
   :py:obj:`.members` property. This property is intended to be treated as an
   array in order to access the different elements available. This
   property also allows a user to create a new member or remove an
   already existing one.
   
   .. py:attribute:: comment

   The name of the ``structure_t``.
      :param getter: Return the name of the structure.
